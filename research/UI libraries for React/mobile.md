Material Kit React
React UI component libraries: Material Kit React
Created with inspiration from Google‚Äôs Material Design, Material Kit React builds a set of elements that put consistency as the main feature. That way, your web project retains a similarity in appearance and functions all through.

The general layout resembles multiple sheets of paper. This imparts a depth and order to the layouts. Three example pages are included. Not only will these pages illustrate what‚Äôs possible with this kit, they also serve as templates where you can substitute text and images with your own.

The kit also contains a number of basic elements such as buttons, badges, sliders, menu, pagination, navigation bars, tabs and pills. You‚Äôll be able to customize the style, size and color for most elements. The JavaScript elements include Modals, tooltips, date-time picker, carousels and popovers. Besides using the kit to start a new project, you can also restyle any old Bootstrap project. The Material Kit React Pro version contains a lot more components, sections and example pages.

## Ant Design for React

This React UI library is a design system for enterprise-level products. It‚Äôs based on the Ant Design project and contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive UIs. The components include internationalization support for dozens of languages.

You also have the ability to customize the components to your own design specifications. Ant Design uses Less.js for its style language. The Ant Design components include buttons, icons, grids, breadcrumb, dropdown menus, pagination, and more.

The project has nearly 60k stars on GitHub, so it‚Äôs hugely popular with developers.

## React Admin

This library is suitable for building business-to-business (B2B) admin applications on top of REST/GraphQL APIs and is customizable by design. It‚Äôs built with a number of well known projects in addition to React: Material UI, React Router, Redux, and React Final Form. The latter is a popular form state management solution.

In addition to the free version and its components, there‚Äôs also an enterprise solution. The enterprise solution includes pro support from Marmelab (the creators) and access to private modules.

React Admin boasts about 12k stars on GitHub, and is actively maintained.

## Material-UI

With a whopping 55K stars on GitHub, Material-UI ranks among the most popular React UI component libraries. The components rely on React, but use Google‚Äôs Material Design. For those of you who need filling in, material design takes inspiration from the physical world and textures while keeping the actual UI elements to a minimum.

A wide range of helpful components are available, like app bars, auto complete, badges, buttons, cards, dialog boxes, icons, menus, sliders and more. Helpfully, Material-UI also offers React themes and templates, so you can have a custom color theme for your app.

## React Bootstrap

Next on our list of React UI component libraries is React Bootstrap, a UI kit that retains it‚Äôs Bootstrap core. In order to give you more control over the form and function of each component, it replaces Bootstrap‚Äôs JavaScript with React. Each component is built to be easily accessible, important for front-end framework building.

And since React Bootstrap doesn‚Äôt deviate much from its Bootstrap origins, developers can choose from the thousands of Bootstrap themes readily available. It‚Äôs earned 14500+ stars on GitHub.
